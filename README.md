CPL Systemless </h1>

**The CPL project began as a fork of the Rootless Pixel Launcher from amirzaidi (Amir Zaidi), who added support for Google News Feed and the 'At a Glance' widget to AOSP Launcher3 and also added many fixes to the original AOSP version. Gradually, CPL became a separate project that provides many options for customizing and fine-tuning the interface.**

**Notes for the Play Store Version:**
1. A complete list of features, solving some problems and other useful (and not quite) information can be found on the [4PDA Forum](http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=903913)
2. To enable the display of weather and Google News Feed, you need to install an additional plugin application, which can be found on the 4PDA Forum via the link on above or on [GitHub page](https://github.com/whataudoinghere/Feed_and_Weather_Plugin/releases)
3. The application was developed for devices with a 'clean' Android, so the successful launch and operation of all functions on third-party shells (MIUI, EMUI, Samsung Experience, etc.) is not guaranteed.
